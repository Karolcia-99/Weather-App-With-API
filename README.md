# Weather-App-With-API
The Weather App is a weather forecast application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The app utilizes a weather API to retrieve live weather data based on the userâ€™s location, providing them with the current weather conditions such as the temperature, condition of the sky (cloudy, sunny, etc.), the humidity and wind speeds.

This allows the user to check the weather in their area at any time.
